TM PHP Course Task Implementation
In this project I try to use some modern web techs, for example this app will be based on PHP OOA Patterns (eg. Singleton, MVC). Also I planning to implement a CRUD application architecture with using Ajax. Interface will be build with the Twitter Bootstrap 3 CSS grid 12 column framework.

Here you may see this app in action: http://magenta.ho.ua/tm-cms/
Thank you for your advise.
